# Linear Logistic Regression with Spark
Project of Massively Parallel Machine Learning at UPM 2016 / 2017.

In this Project, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are implemented based on Spark and Saprk SQL.

* Linear Regression uses Normal Equation and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as a metric.

* Logistic Regression uses Gradient Descent or Netwon's method and Confusion Matrix as a metric.

* TODO, implement Efficient Cross Validation in Spark.
